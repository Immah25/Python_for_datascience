    "#### __Why encapsulation matters__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data protection = Prevents accidental modification of internal data.\n",
    "* Controlled access = you can define getter and setter for safe updates.\n",
    "* Abstraction = Hides complex internal details from the user. \n",
    "* Code flexibility = you van change internal logic later without breaking user code.\n",
    "\n",
    "so inshort, encapsulation is keeping your data safe and provide controlled doors (methods) to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __Abstraction__\n",
    "---\n",
    "Abstraction means only showing the essential features of something and hiding the complex details underneath\n",
    "\n",
    "Its like using a car - you can drive, brake and accelerate but you don't need to know how the engine works, or how fuel turns into motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python terms its about creating a new interface and hiding the messy internal logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of this:-\n",
    "\n",
    "se_calculate_salary(5000)\n",
    "\n",
    "we can offer a simple method like:-\n",
    "\n",
    "se.get_salary()\n",
    "\n",
    "That hides all the inner math, checks and logic \n",
    "\n",
    "That is abstraction; The outside world interacts only with what it needs to know\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __How python supports Abstraction__\n",
    "Python gives us two main ways to apply abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By convention - using naming and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hide the details by; \n",
    "\n",
    "* Prefixing variables/methods with '_' (eg. _calculate_salary).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exposing only high-level public methods (eg set_salary(), get_salary())\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called informal abstraction - it is based on trust and discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Formally using abstract base class(ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where abstraction becomes explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use ABC module to create a base class __what must be done__ but not __how__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __Summary__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction means hiding complex details, showing simple interface. eg get_salary hides _calculate_salary.\n",
    "* Informal abstraction means using '_' and design to hide internal data eg _private_method().\n",
    "* Formal abstraction means using ABC and @abstractionmethod eg class Employee(ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make code easy to use and extend eg cleaner APIs and subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __simple analogy__\n",
    "Think of abstraction like a remote control:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You press a button(play, pause, volume up) - those are public methods\n",
    "* We don't see the complex circuit that makes it all work - that hidden abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __@property__\n",
    "---\n",
    "The @property decorator let's us __access methods like attributes__ while still keeping encapsulation and logic behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "so instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "se.get_salary()\n",
    "\n",
    "we can do this:- \n",
    "\n",
    "se.salary\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like a simple varible, but it can actually be doing calculations, checks or transformations inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hides our internal variables (Encapsulation).\n",
    "* Provide an easy to read interface.\n",
    "* Add logic without breaking existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __Analogy__\n",
    "Think of @property as a \"smart door\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You open it normally (se.salary), but behind it, python might be checking permissions, unlocking, or even re-calculating something you just don't see\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __Ilustration__\n",
    "it turns a method into something that looks like a normal variable, but with controlled access.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Without @property__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __person.get_age()__\n",
    "\n",
    "__With @property__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __person.age__ \n",
    "- looks like accessing a variable\n",
    "This is more cleaner and pythonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __@getter__\n",
    "---\n",
    "in python, we don't write @getter explicitly.\n",
    "The __@property__ decorator is the getter\n",
    "\n",
    "So\n",
    "\n",
    "@property\n",
    "def age(self):\n",
    "    return self._age\n",
    "\n",
    "THis IS the getter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __@setter__\n",
    "---\n",
    "The @age.setter decorator allows you to control how a varible is changed\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can validate input \n",
    "* You can protect the variable\n",
    "* You can add rules when setting a value\n",
